# OmegaBook Mathematica Package

This repository contains the Mathematica package `omegabook`, which is associated with computations done in the paper titled "Higher Operations in Perturbation Theory." 
This work is part of a collaborative project. For more details, please refer to the [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13049).

## Installation

To use the `omegabook` package, clone this repository or download the `omegabook.m` file directly into your Mathematica working directory.

In your Mathematica notebook, load the package by executing either:
```
Get["omegabook.m"]
```
or 
```
Needs["omegabook`"]
```
This will make all the functions available in your current Mathematica session.

Comments are welcome.
